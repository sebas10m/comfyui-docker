# Clones the ComfyUI Manager repository and checks out the latest release; ComfyUI Manager is an extension for ComfyUI that enables users to install
# custom nodes and download models directly from the ComfyUI interface; instead of installing it to "/opt/comfyui/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager", which
# is the directory it is meant to be installed in, it is installed to its own directory; the entrypoint will symlink the directory to the correct
# location upon startup; the reason for this is that the ComfyUI Manager must be installed in the same directory that it installs custom nodes to, but
# this directory is mounted as a volume, so that the custom nodes are not installed inside of the container and are not lost when the container is
# removed; this way, the custom nodes are installed on the host machine
RUN git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI-Manager.git /opt/comfyui-manager && \

# Adds the startup script to the container; the startup script will create all necessary directories in the models and custom nodes volumes that were
# mounted to the container and symlink the ComfyUI Manager to the correct directory; it will also create a user with the same UID and GID as the user
# that started the container, so that the files created by the container are owned by the user that started the container and not the root user
