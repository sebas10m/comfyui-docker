name: Create and publish a Docker image

# Configures this workflow to run when a tag was pushed to the repository that matches the pattern "v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+", which is a semantic
# versioning pattern; this token will be created when a new release is created; the release event cannot be used, because the docker/metadata-action
# action does not support the release event

  push:
    tags:
      - 'v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+'
